# DnD5e Helpers
Little helpers for little 5e tasks.

## Current Features

### Automatic Wild Magic Surge
- Triggers on *any* reduction in current spell slots from a character with the indicated feature (default: Wild Magic Surge)
- Optional homebrews
   - More Surges - a surge triggers on a roll <= spell level. Also recharges Tides of Chaos.
   - Volatile Surges - Similar to More, but adds 1d4 to the spell level if Tides of Chaos has been expended
   - Standard Surges plus - Similar to standard, but also recharges Tides of Chaos.
   - Note: The homebrews look for the designated Tides of Chaos feature and expects it to have "X uses per long rest"
- Blind draw surge table results, which hides the results of the surge from the players.

### Reaction Status Management
- Detects when an action is taken outside of a token's turn and applies a configurable status as a visual reminder. The following details when this will be detected during combat:
   - 1) Whenever a token uses an item with activation of "1 Reaction".
   - 2) Whenever a token uses an item with activation of "1 Action" outside of their turn.
   - 3) Any other item activation will be ignored. For example "0 Action" or "1 Bonus Action"
- Will remove the configured status at the beginning of the token's turn.
- This status used is configurable and should match the name when hovered over in the token hud.
- Supports Combat Utility Belt's custom statuses.
- If auto remove is enabled these statuses will be removed at the end of combat as well.

### Legendary Action Reset on Start of Turn
- All legendary action uses of a creature will reset to their max on the start of their turn in combat.

### Recharge Abilities on Start of Turn
- GM only
- For abilities with a "d6 recharge" on every turn.

### Diagonal Template Scaling
- _I cast...Firesquare!_
- Scales line, cone, and circle type templates upon placement to better fit to the 5/5/5 diagonal rule.
- Line and cone scaling can be enabled independently from circle scaling.
  - Circle templates less than 1 grid unit in radius will not be converted. These small templates are often useful for creating quick token-like markers on the board or used for macros which need the centerpoint maintained.

### Cover Calculator (Beta)
- When a user with a selected token targets another token, the target's cover will be calcuated following the rules presented in DMG pg. 251
- A message in chat will be posted concerning the target's cover in relation to the selected token(s).
- Prioritizes walls, specially flaged tiles, then tokens.
  - Tiles have a new option in their configuration dialog that sets the cover granted by them.
  - Two tiles are now included from game-icons.net that are configured automatically for half and three-quarters cover in modules/dnd5e-helpers/assets/cover-tiles.
- Has two modes for cover in relation to walls: Center Point and Four Corner. Cover from tiles and tokens are (currently) only calculated from Center Point.
  - Center Point - a target token's cover is based on foundry's player vision rendering (center point of self to 4 corners of target)
  - Four Corner - direct implementation of DMG rules, where vision is computed from each occupied grid point and the corner granting the target the least cover is chosen.
  - A more detailed discussion of this can be found on our Wiki
- A new method has been added as ``Token#computeTargetCover``. The usage of it has been detailed in the source code, but is still a work in progress. Basic usage is calling with no arguments with both a selected and targeted token. The return value is a promise of the raw cover data from visibility tests.

### Auto Proficiency Detection
- Will automatically mark a newly added weapon, armor or tool 'proficient' if it is part of the actor's listed proficiencies
- Note: specific weapon or armor proficiencies should match their intended name (ex. "Dagger" proficiency for a weapon called"Dagger").
- For Tools, it tries to match the tool name with the proficiency (Ex. "Flute" will not be detected by checking "Musical Instrument" Tool Proficiency textbox, but "Musical Instrument: Flute" will. To detect "Flute", add "Flute" as a special Tool Proficiency).

### Auto Regeneration
- Automatically checks actors with the Regeneration or Self-Repair features
- Searches the these features for the phrase "X hit points", where X can be a static value or a dice formula
- At the start of their turn, prompts the GM for a roll for the regen and auto applies the healing

### Undead Fortitude
- Automatically checks actors with the Undead Fortitude feature
- When they are reduced to 0hp it will prompt the GM to choose the type of damage that was applied
- Then prompts the GM for a Con save for that actor, and will auto heal the NPC if the roll beats the save needed
- There are two settings for levels of checks:
    - Quick saves will just measure the change in hp and will not measure "overkill"
    - Advanced saves will query the GM for the amount of damage taken as a more complex system

### Open Wounds
- Rolls on an "Injury Table" when specific customisable criteria are met; currently: 
  - Failing a Death Saving Throw by 5 or more
  - Getting critically hit (customisable value)
  - Falling to 0hp
  - Falling to 0hp from a Great Wound

### Great Wound Detection
- Triggers on a reduction of >50% of a token/actor's health.
- Configurable Great Wound table to draw from.
- This will ask for a Great Wound Roll, and will prompt the owner of the token to make a Con Save then roll on the table

### Minimum Roll Dice Modifier
- New die roll modifier added: `mr` (minimum roll)
  - Example: `1d6mr2` will replace any rolls less than 2 with 2s, `1d2mr10` will replace any rolls less than 10 with 10!
  - Spell and Cantrip scaling works as expected. `1d6mr2` in the scaling field will ensure upcasting of Burning Hands will replace 1s with 2s. Cantrip scaling can be left blank in most cases (as per stock dnd5e operation) as the first damage field of the cantrip will be used as the scaling formula.
  - Note: There is no toggle option for this functionality.

## Debug Setting
- Option to add debug logs for troubleshooting
